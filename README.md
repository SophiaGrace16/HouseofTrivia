#House of Trivia - CLI Project

##The Beginning

I started with a lot of ideas. I thought about focusing on dinosaurs, space, animals, sharks, whales, food.. but when looking for an API nothing sparked excitement. Then I stumbled onto a Trivia API. I LOVE trivia. It is something I have always enjoyed so when I saw it I thought "I can use this to create a mini trivia game!" Then immeadiately realized I didn't know where to begin. This is my first project, so my first time coding with out an test files, guides, or tutorials to look at.
